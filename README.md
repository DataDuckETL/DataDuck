## Installation

##### Instructions for using DataDuck ETL

Create a new, empty directory. Inside this directory, create a file named Gemfile, and add the following to it:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'dataduck'
```

Then execute:

    $ bundle install

Finally, run the quickstart command:

    $ dataduck quickstart

The quickstart wizard will ask you for credentials to your database, then create the basic setup for your project. After the quickstart, you'll still need to edit the .env and config/base.yml files, as well as customize your tables. Finally, your project's ETL can be run by running the `dataduck etl all` command.

If you'd like to run this regularly, such as every night, it's recommended to use the [whenever](https://github.com/javan/whenever) gem to manage a cron job to regularly run the ETL.
