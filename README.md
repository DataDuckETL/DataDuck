## Installation

##### Instructions for using DataDuck ETL

Create a new, empty directory. Inside this directory, create a file named Gemfile, and add the following to it:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'dataduck'
```

Then execute:

    $ bundle install

Finally, run the quickstart command:

    $ dataduck quickstart

The quickstart wizard will ask you for credentials to your database, then create the basic setup for your project. After the setup, your project's ETL can be run by running `ruby src/main.rb`

If you'd like to run this regularly, such as every night, it's recommended to use the [whenever](https://github.com/javan/whenever) gem to manage a cron job to regularly run the ETL.
