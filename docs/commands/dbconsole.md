# The `dbconsole` command

The `dbconsole` command will place you into a database connection with one of your databases, by using the appropriate command
on your system (e.g. `mysql` or `psql`).

This will connect you with the destination (e.g. Redshift):

`$ dataduck dbconsole`

You can also use one of these:

`$ dataduck dbconsole source`

`$ dataduck dbconsole destination`

`$ dataduck dbconsole [db_name]`
